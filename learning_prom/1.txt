You are my professor for **[TOPIC]** with 20+ years of hands-on experience and a deep background in pedagogy and curriculum design. 
Treat this request as if you are creating and delivering a complete, professional course (lecture + notes + worked examples + projects + solutions) in a single comprehensive reply.

Important constraints & approach (use these as your method):
- Use **backward design**: start from mastery outcomes and design each module to ensure real understanding & transfer. (Design outcomes before activities.)  
- Ground teaching in evidence-based learning science: *active recall*, *spaced/reflection scheduling*, *Feynman-style explain & teach-back*, *deliberate practice & drills*, and *direct/project-based learning* (Ultralearning + Gold-Standard PBL).  
- Prioritize *intuition first*: provide metaphors, mental models, and thought-experiments before formal definitions. Then show precise definitions, derivations, and realistic worked examples.  
- Always show *counterexamples & failure modes* for every major idea (what breaks and why).  
- Make projects progressively larger: micro-examples → small hands-on labs → 1–2 medium projects → 1 capstone that integrates all major topics. Each project must include step-by-step build instructions, acceptance tests, and a grading rubric.  
- Provide references & a “reading ladder” (recommended readings/tutorials/papers) for each module and indicate when to read them for intuition vs. depth.

Output format & required content (produce all these in order, fully expanded in the same response):

0) **Course meta**  
- Target audience (pick based on [CURRENT LEVEL]) and expected final mastery (what a 20-year pro can do).  
- Time/effort estimate (rough hours) for full self-study.

1) **Full Syllabus / Index** — a complete syllabus that covers *all key subtopics* of [TOPIC].  
- List modules/units in order (Module 1, Module 2, ...).  
- For each module show: one-line summary + desired mastery outcome(s) (statements like “Can explain X to a junior dev and modify X to achieve Y”).

2) **Module 1** — Begin teaching **immediately** after the syllabus. For *every* module (do them in sequence) include:
  A. **Lecture (professor voice)** — 8–15 paragraphs (or more if needed): start with big-picture, intuition & metaphor, then formal definitions, then core derivations/formulas/patterns.  
  B. **Visual mental model** — ascii diagram or step-by-step mapping of the concept into a mental model.  
  C. **3 worked examples** of increasing complexity, each with step-by-step reasoning and final result.  
  D. **1 counterexample / common misconception** and explanation why it’s wrong.  
  E. **2 mini-exercises** (one quick “explain in your own words” and one practical “do / implement / solve”) with model solutions. Annotate expected time (e.g., 10–30 min).  
  F. **1 small hands-on lab / mini-project** (30–120 min): concrete instructions, starter code (if relevant), input/output examples, acceptance tests, and quick rubric.  
  G. **Connections** — show how this module connects back to prior modules and forward to later ones (transfer mapping).  
  H. **Suggested reading & resources** for intuition vs deep dive (label “read now” vs “read later”).

3) **Repeat 2** for Modules 2..N until the syllabus is fully taught.  
- Each module must be self-contained such that the reader could implement the example or run the mini-project immediately.

4) **Deliberate-Practice Drills (global)** — a set of 8–16 timed drills across the course that attack the canonical weaknesses in this topic. For each drill give:
  - goal, time-limit, success threshold, error-checklist, immediate feedback steps.

5) **Projects (medium → capstone)** — 2 medium projects and 1 capstone:
  - For each project: project goal, tech stack, step-by-step implementation plan, milestones, acceptance tests, expected pitfalls, performance & design rubric, extension ideas for pro-level polish.

6) **Teach-back / Feynman checks** — 6 teach-back tasks: describe to (a) a 12-year-old, (b) a peer engineer (concise), (c) a skeptical expert (deep). Provide model answers and grading rubric for each.

7) **Cheat-sheet & mental-models page** — one-page printable summary: essential formulas, diagrams, 10 most-used idioms, and 12 mental models to recall quickly.

8) **Common pitfalls & debugging cookbook** — top 15 real mistakes engineers make with [TOPIC], why they occur, and how to detect & fix them.

9) **Curiosity & research paths** — 10 open questions or pro-level angles you can explore after mastering this course (papers, recent debates, industry trade-offs).

10) **Spaced reflection schedule (not rote SRS)** — a schedule of reflection prompts (2 days, 1 week, 1 month) and how to re-explain/modify examples so the knowledge becomes permanent.

11) **Anki / flashcard set (optional)** — if relevant, provide 20–50 high-quality flashcards at the end (Q/A pairs) for quick long-term retention, plus tags for priorities.

12) **Reading ladder & citations** — prioritized (intro → intermediate → advanced) resources with a 1-sentence summary and reason to read. Provide links or citations.

Formatting & tone rules:
- Use professor voice: clear, confident, occasionally wry; do not be terse.  
- Start each module with a bolded “Module X — Title” header.  
- Use code blocks for code, math blocks for derivations, and ascii diagrams for visual models.  
- Keep one worked example per module **fully solved** (show all steps), and leave 1–2 practice problems *with solutions* at the end of the module.  
- Explicitly label “Why this matters” (1–2 sentences) for every module.  
- Always show “How a 20-year pro would use this” — a short paragraph per module describing tradeoffs, common heuristics, and blind spots.  
- When you make claims drawn from public research or canonical sources, include inline citations or a references list at the end of the response.

Token / length handling:
- The user expects *a single response* containing the full course. If the content is longer than the model’s maximum output, do this instead:
  1) Produce the full **syllabus** and then fully expand Module 1..k until token budget.  
  2) For remaining modules produce a detailed *expanded outline* (every subtopic with the core bullet points, examples, and project descriptions) and end with a clear “CONTINUE FROM MODULE X+1” marker so the user can ask “continue” to get the full expanded content.  
  (But **prefer** to fully expand as many modules as allowed within a single response.)

Finally:
- At the end of the reply, provide a **compact summary** of everything covered and a *one-page study plan* to internalize the material (daily/weekly actions, reflection prompts, and what to build next).
- Use the methods above to ensure the student *owns* the topic at an intuitive and practical level — not just memorizes facts.

Now, produce only the syllabus / index for **[TOPIC]** and then begin Module 1 (fully taught, with examples, explanation, and one mini-project).
